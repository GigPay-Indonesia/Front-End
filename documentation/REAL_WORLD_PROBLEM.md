# The Real-World Problem

Modern businesses do not simply "pay freelancers".

They coordinate money across:
- many departments, subsidiaries, and platforms
- many vendors, creators, and contractors
- many payout rails (IDR bank, USD bank, stablecoins)
- approval rules, limits, and audit requirements
- uncertain timing (milestones, disputes, acceptance windows)
- FX exposure and idle cash inefficiency

## What breaks today

1) Repeated pre-funding  
Every payment requires manual top-ups. Treasury operations are fragmented.

2) No programmable approvals  
Finance ops rely on spreadsheets, chats, and manual signatures.

3) Payout fragmentation  
Money comes in IDR, goes out in USD/USDC/USDT. Reconciliation is painful.

4) Idle capital  
Funds sit dead in accounts while waiting for acceptance or milestones.

5) Risk  
FX volatility, disputes, late acceptance, and counterparty risk are unmanaged.

6) Bad audit trails  
It is difficult to reconstruct who approved what and when.

## Why onchain changes this

Onchain systems allow:
- Every payment to be represented as a PaymentIntent (state machine)
- Every action to emit events (audit-grade)
- Treasury funds to become programmable liquidity
- Execution to be routed: yield, RFQ swap, protection, settlement

## Indonesia-first wedge

Indonesia businesses:
- operate in IDR
- pay global vendors in USD or stablecoins
- suffer from FX friction, delays, and idle cash

IDRX + Base + RFQ infrastructure enables:
- IDRX-native treasury
- Global payouts
- Onchain audit and automation
- Capital efficiency via yield and routing
